# Open UPM: Store Genereted Rsa Key InUnity

This package has one main goal: to store generated RSA keys in Unity.

Since Unity isn’t particularly well-suited for cryptography, I adopted a format that works within the constraints of Unity’s C# implementation.

(_Yeah, I didn’t really have much of a choice on this topic (^^' )_)

It uses another package called **Path Type ReadWrite**.  
This tool helps clarify relative, abstract, file, and directory paths.
